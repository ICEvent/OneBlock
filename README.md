# OneBlock - Web3 Profile Platform

A decentralized profile platform built on Internet Computer, allowing users to create and manage their Web3 identity, posts, and links.

## Features
- Web3 Authentication with Internet Identity
- Profile Management
- Post Creation & Management
- Link Management
- Juno Integration for Storage

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- DFX (latest version)
- Internet Computer Wallet/Identity

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd oneblock


## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:


# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy


Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with


npm run generate


at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with


npm start


Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
